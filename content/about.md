Hello! I'm an SRE at [commercetools](https://commercetools.com/). In my day job I usually look after our company's infrastructure. Automation is my interest!

This blog will mostly write about Linux administration and self-hosting softwares. Most of them will be open-source, and freely available on your favourite distro!
